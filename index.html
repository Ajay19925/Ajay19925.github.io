        <h2>Welcome to my Page</h2>

        <p>I'm Ajay Balaji, a Lead Software Engineer at Gartner. I have completed a master's degree in cybersecurity and bring over a decade of experience as a technology leader. My expertise lies in bridging cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps to create scalable, secure, and high-performance systems. I am known for translating business needs into secure and reliable technology solutions, leading large-scale cloud migrations, and enhancing security across complex enterprise environments. As a trusted partner to executives, engineering teams, and security leaders, I ensure that IT investments drive both innovation and operational resilience.</p>
          
          <p>Most of us believe that our Data is safe & secure, and the actions are private. On the other hand, we are also getting to know about data leakage, system hack, data theft, etc. on the day-to-day basis. This made me to encounter deeply in Data security and its protection. Furthermore, this gave me an idea to proceed my career in Cyber security.
