        <h1>Professional Trainings</h1>
        <p>Below are the some of the tools and trainings which I used while exploring cybersecurity field</p>
        <ul>
        <li><h3>Burp Suite</h3>
          <p><strong>Description: </strong>Burp Suite is an integrated platform/graphical tool for performing security testing of web applications.The web browser's built-in dev console is a great method for quickly viewing and tweaking source code in an HTTP request. However, if you are wanting to do hundreds of complex attack iterations against an application then it'll save you a lot of time in the long run if you use a tool such as Burp. It's a good idea to understand and use both tools. Burp does have a little bit of a learning curve and initial setup time. I have experience in using burp suite to exploit below mentioned vulnerabilites in web application </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Insecure Direct Object References - Insecure Direct Object Reference is when code accesses a restricted resource based on user input, but fails to verify user's authorization to access that resource.</li>
            <li>Cross-Site Request Forgery - It is an attack in which a user is tricked into performing actions on another site by inadvertently clicking a link or a submitting a form.</li>
            <li>Session hijacking - It is an attack where the attacker steals a user's active session with a website to gain unauthorized access to actions and information on that website.</li>
            <li>Cross Site Scripting - It becomes possible when code puts user-supplied data in the response without sanitizing the data first.</li>
          </ul>
        
        </li>
        <li><h3>Capture the Flag (CTF)</h3>
          <p><strong>Description: </strong> Capture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competitions. I have experience of solving 80+ CTF problems in different security aspects via <a href="https://ctf.codepath.com/index.php">site</a> which was developed by Meta. Some of the probelms includes SQL injection,IDOR,CSRF,Cross-Site Scripting,User Enumeration,Password hash,Insecure Cryptographic storage and Steganography</p>
          
        </li>

        <li><h3>Cryptography</h3>
          <p><strong>Description: </strong>The importance of Cryptography in all the digital communication is very crucial. I have experience in decoding the basic level of cryptography algorithm like 'Diffe-Hellman'. I have gained very good understanding of how cryptography is used in web applications to transfer packets via TCP connection without being attacked by someone in the middle. I have very good understanding of hashing algorithms and how that can be used in web applications to protect passwords.</p>
          
        </li>

      </li>

      <li><h3>Pentesting</h3>
        <p><strong>Description: </strong>I gained good understanding of Pen-testing by setting up a older version wordpress site with vulnerabilities. </p>
        <p>My work towards this can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/Ajay19925/CyberSecurity/tree/WordPress-Pentesting">github repository</a></p>
        <p>I extended this work towards live site and analyzed few more vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>My work towards this can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/Ajay19925/CyberSecurity/tree/Live_target_PenTesting">github repository</a></p>
        <p>Pentesting setup procedure will be available in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq8dQTf7DKc">youtube link</a></p>
      </li>

      <li><h3>Kali Linux</h3>
        <p><strong>Description: </strong>Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. I have used kali linux in many area's of my work and projects. Some of the tools which I have explored so far are as follows </p>
        <ul>
          <li>SQLmap</li>
          <li>msfconsole</li>
          <li>Burp Suite</li>
          <li>Nmap</li>
          <li>WireShark</li>
          <li>John the Ripper</li>
          <li>ExifTool</li>
        </ul>
      
      </li>
