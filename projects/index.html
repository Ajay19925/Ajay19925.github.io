        <h1>Project/Research Works</h1>

        <p>Below are the Project/Research works which I did in different courses during my master's program</p>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Secure Data Deletion for File System by Automated Process</h3>
            <h5>From 'Operating Systems' Course</h5>
            <p><strong>Description: </strong>The permanent removal of data from filesystem is a major area of concern mainly because of the misconception that once a file is deleted or storage media is formatted, it cannot be recovered. When a file is deleted, only the file system entry is deleted, thus the content of the file will remain intact for a period of time, depending on the disk activity afterwards. In my Paper I completely analyzed NTFS filesystem and proposed a way to make our file system more secure by making the permanently deleted file unrecoverable after certain amount of time automatically.</p>
            <p>For more information, this paper can be found in this <a href="https://ajay19925.github.io/assets/paper/Project.pdf">pdf</a>.</p>
            <p>Completed on: Aug 2022</p></li>
