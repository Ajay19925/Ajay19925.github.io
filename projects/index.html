        <h1>Project/Research Works</h1>

        <p>Below are the Project/Research works which I did in different courses during my master's program</p>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Secure Data Deletion for File System by Automated Process</h3>
            <h5>From 'Operating Systems' Course</h5>
            <p><strong>Description: </strong>The permanent removal of data from filesystem is a major area of concern mainly because of the misconception that once a file is deleted or storage media is formatted, it cannot be recovered. When a file is deleted, only the file system entry is deleted, thus the content of the file will remain intact for a period of time, depending on the disk activity afterwards. In my Paper I completely analyzed NTFS filesystem and proposed a way to make our file system more secure by making the permanently deleted file unrecoverable after certain amount of time automatically.</p>

            <p>Completed on: Aug 2022</p></li>

            <li><h3>Password-Less Authentication for Mobile Web Application</h3>
              <h5>From 'Information,Security and Privacy' Course</h5>
              <p><strong>Description: </strong>Password authentication is standard and widely used because it is cost-effective and easy to manage. But it is challenging for the users in complying with strong password policies on choosing and keeping them private in heavily regulated industries. Recent studies highlighted that the password approach is responsible for 81% of hacking-related breaches either by week and/or stolen credentials. In addition to that, storing the millions of user credentials (including Plain / Encrypted passwords) in a cloud or an on-prem server can render a single point of the target for hackers. In my paper I studied about FIDO2 standard and how it can be enhanced for mobile passwordless authentications.</p>

              <p>Completed on: Dec 2021</p></li>

              <li><h3>Study on Mobile Payment Systems: Security with Respect to Different Technologies (Present and the Future)</h3>
                <h5>From 'Mobile Security' Course</h5>
                <p><strong>Description: </strong>This was taken as a group project. In this project I studied about NFC based mobile payment systems. In my paper we talked about how security is currently implemented in NFC Mobile payment system and how in future it can be enchnaced to overcome the challenges.</p>
                <p>For more information, this paper can be found in this <a href="https://ajay19925.github.io/assets/paper/Project3.pdf">pdf</a>.</p>
                <p>Completed on: Dec 2022</p></li>
				
				<li><h3>Pentesting on closed environment</h3>
                <h5>From 'Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis' Course</h5>
                <p><strong>Description: </strong>The main goal of this project is to undertsand all the technical and procedural concept behind a pentesting task. By this project I gained knowledge in how to setup a closed and safe environment to carry out pentesting, how to identify vulneraiblities in app or website or network or configuration, how to exploit vulnerabilities, how to score risk and how to write pentesting reports. </p>
                <p>For more information, My Pentesting Report can be found in this <a href="https://ajay19925.github.io/assets/Report/Pentesting-Report-NBN.pdf">pdf</a>.</p>
                <p>Completed on: Dec 2023</p></li>
